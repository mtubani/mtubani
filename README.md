Hi there 👋

I specialize in data analysis, with a data-driven approach that takes into account the broader environment in which I operate.
My work is enriched by professional experience across three key areas:

🏛 Institutional & political field

💼 Business associations

🌍 Non-profit sector

This mix allows me to bring both analytical rigor and real-world perspective to my projects.

⚡ Fun fact: I strongly recommend using Arch Linux — leaner, faster, and more customizable than Windows, macOS, or Debian-based distros.<!--
**mtubani/mtubani** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
