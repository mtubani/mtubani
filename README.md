I specialize in data analysis, with a data-driven approach that takes into account the broader environment in which I operate.
My work is enriched by professional experience across three key areas:

🏛 Institutional & political field
💼 Business associations
🌍 Non-profit sector

This mix allows me to bring both analytical rigor and real-world perspective to my projects.

⚡I strongly recommend using Arch Linux — leaner, faster, and more customizable than Windows, macOS, or Debian-based distros.
