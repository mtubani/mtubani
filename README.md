#### I specialize in data analysis. My approach is data-driven, considering the entire environment in which I work. Therefore, my data analysis is complemented by the work experience I have gained in three main areas: the institutional-political field, business associations, and the non-profit sector.  

#### By the way, I recommend using Arch Linux instead of Windows, macOS, or Debian-based distributions.
