#### I deal with data analysis. My approach is data-driven, bearing in mind the whole environment I work in. Data analysis is therefore completed with the work experience gained in three main areas: the institutional-political field, the business associations and non-profit sectors.

#### And, btw, don't use Windows, macOS, Debian-based or Arch-based distros. Use Arch Linux.
